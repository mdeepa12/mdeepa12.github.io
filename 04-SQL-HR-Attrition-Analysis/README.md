## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  
- **Rows**: ~1,400 employees  
- **Key Columns**: Attrition, Department, JobRole, Age, MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany, Gender

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analysis (SQL)
1. **Attrition Rate by Department**  
   - Which departments see the most exits?  

2. **Attrition by Job Role**  
   - Roles with highest % attrition.  

3. **Attrition by Age Band**  
   - Which age groups are leaving most?  

4. **Attrition vs Salary Bands**  
   - Relationship between pay level and attrition.  

5. **Tenure Analysis**  
   - Average years at company for attrited vs active employees.

## 📊 Insights
- Sales department and HR roles have higher attrition rates.  
- Younger employees (<30) show the highest turnover.  
- Employees with low salaries (<3,000) are more likely to quit.  
- Attrited employees have significantly shorter average tenure.
